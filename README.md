ISL Academy â€“ Indian Sign Language Learning Tool

ISL Academy is a simple educational web application designed to help users learn and practice Indian Sign Language (ISL). The platform includes learning resources, quizzes for self-assessment, and an integrated AI tool to detect hand signs using the user's webcam.

Features:

- Learn commonly used Indian Sign Language signs
- Take interactive quizzes to test sign recognition
- Track and view progress
- Use webcam to test hand signs with AI-based feedback

AI Integration:

- The platform includes a backend service connected to a trained hand gesture recognition model
- It uses the user's webcam input and analyzes gestures using OpenCV and Python
- The model provides real-time feedback to help users practice accurate signs

Technologies Used:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- AI: Trained gesture detection model using OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras

How to Run:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the backend Flask server
3. Open index.html in a browser to access the learning and quiz modules
4. Use the hand detection page to interact with the AI tool

Notes:

- Designed to assist beginners in learning ISL with minimal setup
- AI model works best in proper lighting and with a neutral background
- Project is actively being improved with more signs and better detection
